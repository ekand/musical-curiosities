This directory houses a mashup of 'Happy Birthday' and Markov chains.
The python code takes text input in the format of text showing
a midi event stream captured by Sonic Pi.
It parses this input to create an ordered list of numbers
that represent the happy birthday melody.
It then generates a dictionary of with keys being note numbers
and values being a list of notes that could come next.
Finally, it writes to a file code that can be executed
by sonic pi.
I will soon put a recording of the resulting audio on sound
cloud, and a video showing the process on youtube.
