This directory houses a mashup of 'Happy Birthday' and Markov chains.


The python code takes text input in the format of text showing
a midi event stream captured by Sonic Pi.  
It parses this input to create an ordered list of numbers
that represent the happy birthday melody.  
It then generates a dictionary of with keys being note numbers
and values being a list of notes that could come next.  
Finally, it writes to a file code that can be executed
by sonic pi.  
You can hear an example of the audio on soundcloud:

There will also soon be a video on youtube
explaining how I did this.
